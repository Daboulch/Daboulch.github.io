    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>My main hobby has been playing games.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I've been playing games since I was a kid and I will most likely<br>continue to play them for a long time since it is 
        very easy to chill and play with friends.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A new hobby I want to try is snowboarding.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I've wanted to go snowboarding for a long time but never really had the opportunity to actually do it.<br> I'm hoping to try it this year but most likely next year.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Another hobby I want to try to get into is rock climbing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I went rock climbing about a year ago and it was extremely fun but,<br> it is also quite challenging and something that you can progress at over time.</p>
