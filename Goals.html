    <h1>Current Goals</h1>
    <p>My main focus is finishing college and making sure I stay caught up with classes since its very easy to get distracted and lose motivation to do work when you are online.</p>
    <p>My other goals would be to try out some new <a href="https://daboulch.github.io/Hobbies.html">hobbies</a> soon before I get more busy with school and eventually work.</p>

    <h2>Some short term goals</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start working out</li>
        <li>Read some books</li>
        <li>Go out with friends more</li>
    </ol>
